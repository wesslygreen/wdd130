  <p1>Hi everyone, I am very excited to work in this class and be able to learn more about creating web pages.
        I am from Guatemala, and this is my second year here at BYUI. I am a Software Engineering Major and I love my carrer.
        I served a mission in Sao Paulo Interlagos, Brazil, and it was one of the most especial experiences I have ever had.
        I really love playing and watching soccer, it is my favorite sport. My favorite food is sushi. </p1>
